  The "help" command, executed without arguments, shows the names of all
  commands including the names and types of all of their parameters.

  The "help" command can also be passed the name of a command. Commands
  may include extended help messages such as the one you are reading
  right now.

  Example: waxmill help help

$ ./waxmill help vm-console

    --configuration
      The path to the configuration file (environment variable:
      $WAXMILL_CONFIGURATION_FILE)
    --dry-run
      Show the commands that would be executed, but do not execute them.
      Default: false

  The "vm-console" command attempts to connect to the primary console
  for the given virtual machine. In practice, this means executing the
  "cu"[0] program on the device node that represents the console for
  the VM. The command will fail with a diagnostic error message if the
  virtual machine has no console, or has multiple consoles.
